## 🛠 Prerequisites Setup

### 1. Install Node.js and npm

Since Node.js isn't detected on your system, install it:

**Windows:**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS version (recommended)
3. Run the installer and follow instructions
4. Restart your terminal/PowerShell

**Alternative - Using Chocolatey:**
```powershell
# Install Chocolatey first (if not installed)
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Install Node.js
choco install nodejs
```

### 2. Verify Installation

After installing Node.js, verify in a new terminal:

```bash
node --version    # Should show v18+ or v20+
npm --version     # Should show npm version
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd habitflow-ai
npm install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
# Frontend Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your web app will be available at: **http://localhost:3000**

### 4. Start Your Backend API (Optional)

In a separate terminal, start your Python backend:

```bash
python main.py
```

The app works in demo mode even without the backend!
